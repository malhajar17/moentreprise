### Design Elements
- **Color Palette**: Primary colors are red-rose and white, creating a romantic and elegant atmosphere. Neutral tones such as gray for text and UI elements to maintain balance and readability.
  
- **Typography**: A modern sans-serif typeface like Open Sans or Roboto to ensure clarity. Headings will be larger and bold for emphasis, while body text will be kept at a regular size with standard weight for readability.

- **Imagery**: High-quality, professionally-taken images of floral arrangements, ensuring they are vibrant and align with the romantic theme.

### Interactions & UI Patterns

### Accessibility

- **Alt Text**: Provide alt descriptions for all images to aid users with screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard input.

### Performance Optimization
